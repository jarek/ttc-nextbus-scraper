A script for scraping next transit departures for several stops
and presenting them in one basic HTML page.

Data from NextBus XML API. Currently hardcoded to Toronto/TTC
and a few stops of interest to me.

Python 2 with only stdlib dependencies. Could work with Python 3
if use of `urllib2` is replaced.

Written in 2010 and revived in 2018.
